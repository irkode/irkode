### Starting to create site content

Setting up the basic page following the guides at [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) was quite easy.

Next is using Jekyll for the site and that's also well documented here [Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

## Change history

* Changed Theme to just-the-docs
* Added page modification dates to the footer
* switched to use _jekyll _data folder for timestamps<br>
  moved timestamp to custom header
