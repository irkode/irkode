## Disclaimer

All stuff published here is "As-Is"

* This is what *I* did on *my* machine(s) in *my* environment.
* It might work for others or *not*.
* None of that targets to be a step-by-step guide - just the final version of my notes
* just copy 'n' paste stuff - most of the time - is a bad idea. Be vigilant.
* It might be helpful, useless, or even destructive for others.

## Site construction

The side is automatically build using the standard github action utilizing remote theme [just-the-docs].

Currently the site is build with the following configuration
* standard Github pages build, delivered from gh-pages
* remote-theme just-the-docs
  * small adjustments to the _CSS_
* custom footer to include last modification date
  * manual local pre-commit step

### Summary

This is my playground for publishing a site with [GitHub pages]..
