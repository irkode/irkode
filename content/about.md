## Disclaimer

All stuff published here is "As-Is"

- This is what _I_ did on _my_ machine(s) in _my_ environment.
- It might work for others or _not_.
- None of that targets to be a step-by-step guide - just the final version of my notes
- just copy 'n' paste stuff - most of the time - is a bad idea. Be vigilant.
- It might be helpful, useless, or even destructive for others.

## Site construction

The site is build with the following configuration:

- Edited locally
- Build and deployed with a GitHub Action based on [GitHub deploy - Hugo Guide (step 6)](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#procedure).
- Using the quite bare theme starter [Hugo Zen Theme] by @frjo.

### Summary

This is my playground for publishing a site with [Hugo] and [GitHub Pages]..
